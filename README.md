This project was created as a final display of the knowledge acquired while at Launch Academy's 18 week bootcamp.  While in the program, I learned Rails, React.js, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  

This application is built using:
  * Ruby on Rails
  * React.js
  * Google Charts for React
  * Devise

This application utilizes APIs from AlphaVantage and FinnHub:
